# Chalkscript
My LUA Script for Stand

This is a Script for GTA, made in LUA.
Chalkscript is meant to be used with the GTA 5 Mod Menu 'Stand', and can only be Run from there.
Chalkscript has Features that you Probably haven't even thought of when it comes to GTA Modding.
Chalkscript will also give you a Notification and Update Button in-Game, when Updated in Github, so you only have to Download it Once!

Have Fun!
